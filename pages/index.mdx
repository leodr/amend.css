# Quicker, Simpler Websites.

amend.css is a classless CSS library that gets your site up and running as quick
as possible.

## Get Started

To get started with `amend.css` add its stylesheet to the `<head>` of your
document along with the stylesheet for the default "Inter" font:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/amend.css@1.0.0/amend.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css" />
```

Congrats, you have successfully installed `amend.css`! Now go ahead and write
your regular HTML and watch it turn into something beautiful.

## Versioning

Patch versions will only contain bug fixes. Minor versions can include design
changes, so if you do not want your design to possibly change, specify a version
with the tilde operator.

And if you trust me to have a good taste in design, you can use the regular
versioning.

## Usage With a Build Process

If you are using a build process, you can import the stylesheet directly into
your css:

```js
import "amend.css/amend.css";
```

## Syntax Highlighting

`amend.css` already includes a syntax highlighting theme for
[Prism](https://prismjs.com/). To have your code highlighted automatically, just
add the Prism `<script>` to your website:

```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/prismjs@1.22.0/prism.js" />
```

Syntax highlighting is activated for `<pre>` tags that contain a `<code>`-tag
with its language set as the class.

```html
<pre>
    <code class="language-html">
        <!-- Lots of code... -->
    </code>
</pre>
```

Or inline `<code>` elements, that also have the classname `language-*`.

```html
<code class="language-html">
    <!-- Lots of code... -->
</code>
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

        Isn't this abusing TailwindCSS for something it was not made for?
    </summary>
    Yes, that is exactly whats happening, but Tailwind is abusing PostCSS for something
    it was not made for, so I guess it does not matter {"¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"}.
